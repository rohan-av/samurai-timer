# Samurai Timer

Inspired by the board game [*Samurai*](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3/samurai), or rather, inspired by a blitz version of the game idealized by two friends that utilizes a modification of the Byo-Yomi variation of time control.

Each player will have a set amount of extra lives, and will be given a certain duration to make each move. In the case they are unable to do so, they expend a life and get an additional amount of time that is equal to the turn duration. Losing all extra lives results in an instant loss.
